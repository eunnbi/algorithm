## Floyd's Tortoise üê¢ and Hare üêá Algorithm

**Detecting the First Element in the Loop**

- Two Pointers
  - Slow Pointer (tortoise): moves by 1 node at a time
  - Fast Pointer (hare): moves by 2 node at a time
- S and F point to the same node. A loop is detected.
- If a loop is found, we want to find the first element of the loop.
- Move S to the beginning and move forward both points by 1 node at a time.
- S and F met. This is the first element in the loop.

/*
üëÄ Approach

- Find the maximum of "min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)" (left < right)
- Narrowing two pointers
- Both "i++" and "j--" will decrease the with of container by 1.
- Therefore, to increase the area, we need to "increase the height."
- But, if "a[i] < a[j]" , "j--" will never increase the height.
- So, if "a[i] < a[j]" , "i++", and  if "a[i] > a[j]" , "j--"

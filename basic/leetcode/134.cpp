/*
delta[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]

- If delta[i] â‰¥ 0, the remaining amount of gas increases after traveling to station i+1 â‡’ no problem
- If delta[i] < 0, the amount decreases. We must have enough amount of gas before traveling. => problem

ðŸ’¡  We can find out that the problem is somewhat related to the subrarray sum of delta
